# Order-Processing-Application
# Project Overview:
Niko Apparel Systems is a Hamilton-based company doing its fabrication business. Currently, they are handling their team’s orders by emailing back and forth. They are having trouble keeping track of the orders and tallying up the product sizes by putting everything in the excel sheet.    

Now, Niko Apparel Systems order systems are handling the team’s order by emailing and transferring data to the Excel sheet which means more work for them. We are expecting to reduce this problem by bringing a web-based Team order system. It can get all the required information for the seller and the customers. Moreover, tallying up the sizes with the corresponding product categories is all done by humans. We all know that human error can happen every time and it’s a tedious job. By bringing this application can get rid of human errors. We make all these things work under one shed. However, we are pretty sure that we can bring more orders to our clients in a better and efficient way.
